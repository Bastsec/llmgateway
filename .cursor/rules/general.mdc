# General rules

always start work on agent requests immediately without needing confirmation

never use `as any` or `: any` in typescript files.

when writing commit messages, always use the [conventional commit messages format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

before committing, run `pnpm format`.
also, always run `pnpm build` to ensure there are no errors.
if there are errors or if any API routes were modified, run `pnpm generate`.
