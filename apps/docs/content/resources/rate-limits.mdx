# Rate Limits

LLMGateway implements rate limits to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users. The rate limits differ based on your account status and the type of models you're using.

## Free Models

Free models (models with zero input and output pricing) have rate limits that depend on your account's credit status:

### Base Rate Limits

For organizations with **zero credits**:

- **5 requests per 10 minutes**
- Applies to all free model requests
- Resets every 10 minutes

### Elevated Rate Limits

For organizations that have **purchased at least some credits**:

- **20 requests per minute**
- Applies to all free model requests
- Resets every minute

<Callout type="info">
	When using free models with elevated limits, your credits will **not** be
	deducted. The elevated rate limits are simply a benefit for users who have
	added credits to their account.
</Callout>

## Paid Models

**Paid AI models are not currently rate limited.** You can make as many requests as needed to paid models, subject only to your account's credit balance and any provider-specific limits.

## Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limit information in the headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 20
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 19
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit window resets

## Rate Limit Exceeded

When you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
	"error": {
		"message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.",
		"type": "rate_limit_error",
		"code": "rate_limit_exceeded"
	}
}
```

## Best Practices

### Upgrading Your Limits

To unlock elevated rate limits for free models:

1. Add credits to your account through the dashboard
2. Your rate limits will automatically increase to 20 requests per minute
3. Free model usage will still not deduct from your credits

### Handling Rate Limits

- Implement exponential backoff when you receive 429 responses
- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header to avoid hitting limits
- Consider using paid models for high-volume applications

### Cost Optimization

- Use free models for development and testing
- Switch to paid models for production workloads requiring higher throughput
- Monitor your usage patterns through the dashboard

<Callout type="success">
	Adding even a small amount of credits to your account (e.g., $5) will
	immediately upgrade your free model rate limits from 5 requests per 10 minutes
	to 20 requests per minute.
