# Image Generation

LLMGateway supports image generation models through the standard chat completions API. These models can create images based on text prompts and return them as base64-encoded data URLs.

## Available Models

You can find all available image generation models on our [models page](https://llmgateway.io/models?filters=1&imageGeneration=true).

## Making Requests

Image generation works through the same `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint as text models. Simply use an image generation model and provide a text prompt describing the image you want to create.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.llmgateway.io/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Generate an image of a cute golden retriever puppy playing in a sunny meadow"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Response Format

Image generation models return responses in the standard chat completions format, with generated images included in the `images` array within the assistant message:

```json
{
	"id": "chatcmpl-1756234109285",
	"object": "chat.completion",
	"created": 1756234109,
	"model": "gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
	"choices": [
		{
			"index": 0,
			"message": {
				"role": "assistant",
				"content": "Here's an image of a cute dog for you: ",
				"images": [
					{
						"type": "image_url",
						"image_url": {
							"url": "data:image/png;base64,<base64_encoded_image_data>"
						}
					}
				]
			},
			"finish_reason": "stop"
		}
	],
	"usage": {
		"prompt_tokens": 8,
		"completion_tokens": 1303,
		"total_tokens": 1311
	}
}
```

## Vision support

You can edit or modify images by combining image generation with [vision models](https://docs.llmgateway.io/features/vision) by including the image in the `messages` array.

## Response Structure

### Images Array

The `images` array contains one or more generated images with the following structure:

- `type`: Always `"image_url"` for generated images
- `image_url.url`: A data URL containing the base64-encoded image data (format: `data:image/png;base64,<data>`)

### Content Field

The `content` field may contain descriptive text about the generated image, depending on the model's behavior.

## Usage Notes

<Callout type="info">
	Image generation models typically have higher token costs compared to
	text-only models due to the computational requirements of image synthesis.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
	Generated images are returned as base64-encoded data URLs, which can be large.
	Consider the payload size when integrating image generation into your
	applications.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

- Be specific and descriptive in your prompts for better results
- Include details about style, composition, lighting, and mood
- Experiment with different models to find the best fit for your use case

### Handling Responses

- Parse the `images` array to extract generated images
- The base64 data can be directly used in HTML `<img>` tags or saved to files
- Consider implementing proper error handling for failed generation requests

### Cost Optimization

- Monitor token usage as image generation can be more expensive than text generation
- Use auto routing to automatically select cost-effective image generation models
- Cache generated images when appropriate to avoid repeated generation costs
