We're excited to release **Team Members** — a complete, seat-based way to collaborate with your organization inside LLM Gateway.

## 👥 Invite Teammates with Roles

Choose the right access level for every person:

**Owner**: Full access to all features including team management, billing, and organization settings.

**Admin**: Can manage team members, projects, and API keys, but cannot access billing settings or modify owners.

**Developer**: Can view and use projects and API keys, but cannot modify team or organization settings.

**Restricted Access (API-only)**: If you want a user to just access the API but not the dashboard or settings, just add an API key for them, where you can also set specific permissions.

## 💺 Seats and Pricing

- **Included seats**: Your plan includes 3 seats by default
- **Add more anytime**: Additional members are **$10/seat/month**
- **Fair billing**: Charges are **prorated** to your billing cycle
- **Flexible management**: Removing a user instantly frees a seat; reassign seats as your team changes

> Tip: The invite dialog shows how many seats you have left and the prorated cost (when applicable) before you confirm.

## 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Controls (Optional Upgrade)

For larger teams with stricter requirements, Enterprise unlocks:

- **SSO/SAML** and **SCIM** provisioning
- **Audit logs** with extended retention
- **Advanced permissions** and optional custom roles
- **Dedicated support**, custom SLAs, and invoiced billing

**Interested?** [Contact sales](/enterprise) to enable Enterprise for your organization.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. Go to **Settings → Team** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Member** and enter their email
3. Select a **Role** (Owner, Admin, or Developer)
4. Review included seats and any **prorated seat cost**, then **Add Member**

That's it — your teammate receives an invite and gains access based on the role you selected.
