We're excited to announce the launch of [**LLM Gateway Chat**](https://chat.llmgateway.io) - a powerful, modern chat interface that lets you interact with any LLM model in our ecosystem. Built with the latest AI technologies, it's the fastest way to explore, compare, and build with cutting-edge language models.

## A Playground Built on Modern AI Stack

The playground is powered by:

- **Vercel AI SDK v5** - The latest AI SDK for seamless streaming and multi-modal support
- **AI Elements** - Beautiful, accessible UI components designed specifically for AI interactions
- **LLMGateway AI SDK Provider** - Native integration with our unified API gateway

This tech stack ensures you get a smooth, responsive experience whether you're generating text, creating images, or experimenting with different models.

## Key Features

### üé® Image Generation Support

Generate stunning images directly in the chat interface. Simply select an image generation model like `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` or any other compatible model, describe what you want to create, and watch the AI bring your ideas to life. All generated images are displayed inline with zoom support for detailed viewing.

### üîç Advanced Model & Provider Selection

Finding the right model for your task has never been easier. Our advanced selector lets you:

- **Filter by Capabilities** - Vision, image generation, function calling, reasoning, and more
- **Filter by Providers** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and 20+ other providers
- **Filter by Price Range** - Find models that fit your budget with real-time pricing information

The intelligent search helps you discover the perfect model whether you're optimizing for cost, performance, or specific capabilities.

### üìé File Attachments

Upload and share files directly in your conversations. Perfect for vision models that can analyze images, documents, and other visual content. Simply drag and drop or click to attach.

### üí¨ Seamless Chat Experience

- **Streaming responses** - See AI thinking in real-time
- **Reasoning display** - View extended thinking for supported models
- **Message history** - All your conversations are automatically saved
- **Multiple chats** - Organize different experiments and projects
- **Copy responses** - Quick actions to copy, regenerate, or continue conversations

## Coming Soon

We're not stopping here. These features are already in progress:

## Built for Developers

The playground isn't just for trying out models - it's a development tool. Use it to:
